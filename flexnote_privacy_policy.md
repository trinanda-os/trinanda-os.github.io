# Privacy Policy for FlexNote

**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **FlexNote** ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your information. Your privacy is a priority, and the App is designed to operate with minimal data collection.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### User-Generated Content

FlexNote is a note-taking application. All notes, text, and media you input into the App are **stored locally** on your device. We do not upload your notes to external servers, nor do we have access to the content of your notes.

### Location Data (GPS)

FlexNote may request access to your device's **GPS location** only if you choose to use features that require it (e.g., tagging a note with a location).

* **Purpose:** To provide location-based context to your notes.
* **Storage:** This data is stored locally on your device as part of your note metadata.
* **Control:** This is an optional feature. You can grant or revoke location permissions at any time through your Android system settings.

## 2. Data Storage and Security

Because your data is stored locally:

* **No Cloud Storage:** We do not host your data on our servers.
* **User Responsibility:** You are responsible for backing up your data and securing your device. If you uninstall the App or factory reset your device, your locally stored notes may be permanently deleted.

## 3. Third-Party Services

FlexNote does not share your personal information or location data with third-party advertisers or data brokers.

## 4. Children’s Privacy

Our App does not knowingly collect any personal identifiable information from children. Since all data is stored locally on the user's device, we do not have a database of user ages or identities.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. Changes are effective immediately upon being posted within the App or on our official store listing.
