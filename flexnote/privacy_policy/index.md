# FlexNote Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 18, 2025

This Privacy Policy describes how **FlexNote** ("we," "our," or "the App") handles your information. Your privacy is a priority, and the App is designed to prioritize local storage and user control.

## 1. Information Collection and Use

### User-Generated Content & Media

FlexNote allows you to create notes and attach **image files** from your device.

* **Storage:** All notes and attached images are **stored locally** on your device.
* **Access:** The App requires permission to access your gallery or media storage only to allow you to select and display images within your notes. We do not upload these images to any external servers.

### Phone Numbers

If you input a **phone number** into a note:

* **Storage:** This data is stored strictly as part of the local note file on your device.
* **Usage:** We do not use your phone number for authentication, marketing, or communication purposes. It is treated as private text content.

### Location Data (GPS)

FlexNote may request access to your device's **GPS location** only if you choose to use features that require it (e.g., geotagging a note).

* **Storage:** This data is saved locally as metadata for that specific note.
* **Control:** You can enable or disable location permissions at any time via Android Settings.

## 2. Data Storage and Security

Because your data is stored locally:

* **No Cloud Sync:** We do not host your notes, images, or contact details on our servers.
* **Data Loss:** Please be aware that deleting the App or clearing App data may result in the loss of your stored notes and images, as we do not maintain backups.

## 3. Third-Party Access

FlexNote does not share, sell, or trade your images, phone numbers, or location data with third-party services, advertisers, or analytics providers.

## 4. Permissions

To function correctly, FlexNote may request:

* **Storage/Media:** To save and view image attachments.
* **Location:** To add location tags to notes (optional).
